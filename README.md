# Requirements
To run this project, make sure that `Python 3.7` and `pip` are installed. 

You will need to install certain python libraries. To do so, open a terminal, and execute (from this directory):

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# Running the project
To run the project, open a terminal, and execute (from this directory):

```python a1.py [file path]```

For example, assuming there is a file `all_sentiment_shuffled.txt` in the same directory:

```python a1.py all_sentiment_shuffled.txt```

After a succesful execution of the project, three files will be created, each corresponding to a model (Naive Bayes, Base Decision Tree, Best Decision Tree), containing the results from evaluating a model on a portion of the data set. By default, 80% of the data set will be used to train the models, and 20% of the data will be used to evaluate the models.
